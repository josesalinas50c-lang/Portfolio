# Agricultural Productivity Consulting Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project was developed for **Gestores Financieros y Actuariales**, an agricultural company in Honduras specializing in bell pepper cultivation. The study aimed to maximize profitability through optimized crop planning, risk analysis, and decision-support tools.

We designed a system capable of projecting **10-year crop profitability** by combining optimization models with Monte Carlo simulations for price variability. The solution also included the development of a **web-based application and interactive demo** to allow managers to test different crop allocations and instantly visualize outcomes.

## üèóÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Problem Definition
- Lack of structured financial analysis in crop planning.  
- Limited access to data-driven productivity advisory in the region.  
- Need for risk evaluation (climate, market volatility, production cycles).

### 2. Approach
- **Experiment Design & Literature Review**: Analyzed existing agricultural models.  
- **Data Collection**: Historical costs, yields, labor, irrigation, and international market prices.  
- **Optimization Model**: Objective function to maximize **ROI** under constraints of land, budget, and production cycles.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Generated 10,000 price scenarios per crop using historical mean and standard deviation, accounting for correlations.  
- **Application Development**: Interactive web interface (HTML + backend scripts) allowing managers to:
  - Select specific crops.  
  - Adjust constraints (hectares, costs, markets).  
  - Run simulations and instantly obtain profitability projections.

## üìä Key Results
- **Optimal crop mix** significantly outperformed random selections:  
  - +394% higher potential income in 10 years.  
  - +401% higher profitability in optimal vs random allocation scenarios.  
- **Risk analysis** showed correlations between crops (e.g., negative correlation between tomato and strawberry prices).  
- **Monte Carlo simulations** provided robust distributions of future ROI instead of a single deterministic estimate.

## üíª Application & Demo
An interactive **web-based optimizer and simulator** was delivered, including:
- User-friendly crop selection interface.  
- Customizable parameters for hectares, costs, and export markets.  
- Visualizations of simulated outcomes (expected ROI, distributions, risk bands).  

üëâ A live demo of the Monte Carlo simulator was also built, enabling stakeholders to test scenarios and understand how crop choices impact profitability.

## ‚úÖ Benefits
- **Data-driven decision-making** for agricultural managers.  
- **Risk-aware planning** integrating climate and price variability.  
- **Flexibility**: Tool adapts to different crops, regions, and constraints.  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and increases profitability vs traditional planning.

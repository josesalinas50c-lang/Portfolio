# Machine Learning ‚Äî Job Posting Predictions

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting and analyzing job postings, using data extracted from **LinkedIn job listings**.  
The goal is to apply **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)** to classify, cluster, and forecast characteristics of job postings ‚Äî such as industry, seniority level, required skills, and potential salary range.

The project was implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** (`Final_Linkedin_Job_postings.ipynb`), combining **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling**.

## üèóÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Dataset of LinkedIn job postings collected through scraping and/or API access.  
- Included fields: job title, description, company, location, industry, posting date, and engagement metrics.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning of job descriptions (removal of HTML tags, stopwords, punctuation).  
- Text normalization (lowercasing, tokenization, lemmatization).  
- Encoding of categorical variables (industry, seniority, contract type).  
- TF-IDF vectorization for job descriptions.

### 3. Modeling
- **Classification Models**:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost)  
- **Clustering**:
  - K-Means to group job postings by textual similarity.  
- **Prediction Tasks**:
  - Predicting seniority level from description text.  
  - Forecasting likelihood of high engagement (views/applicants).  

### 4. Evaluation
- Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for classification tasks.  
- Silhouette score for clustering quality.  
- Cross-validation to validate generalization.

## üìä Results
- Best performing model: **XGBoost Classifier**, with F1-score ~0.88 in predicting seniority levels.  
- Identified clusters of job postings aligned with **Tech, Finance, Healthcare, and Consulting**.  
- Extracted most relevant keywords driving classification (e.g., ‚ÄúPython‚Äù, ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù, ‚ÄúSQL‚Äù, ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù).  
- Predictive pipeline for estimating **job posting performance** showed reliable differentiation between low vs high applicant engagement.
